# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Description

In this repository, I have built a rock, paper, scissors game using JavaSript.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
Users can play rock, paper, scissors against an automated opponent. The user will be presented with an alert screen where they can choose R, P, or S. The computer will generate a random R, P, or S value in return. The game will then alert the player the amount of times they have lost, won, or tied, and the player will be asked if they'd like to play again.
